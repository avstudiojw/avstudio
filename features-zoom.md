### YOU NEED CO-HOST privilages
With AVStudio you can not log in as host and start a meeting. 
You can only share media, and administring participants when having Co-Host privilages.

A toast notification is shown, if you have not such privilages.

!IMPORTANT 
If you use AVStudio on the same computer as the host, the host has to "leave to computer audio"!

You can switch to active speaker or gallery view anytime and come back to screen share view.

A toast notification will popup with text "... is sharing screen". This is helpfull if someone else is sharing his screen. It either way you can stop your or his screen sharing by clicking the quick action: stop.

You can than stop the screen sharing by clicking the button. The media does not stop, though. Only the screen share within Zoom stops!
